The Receiver operating charachteristics  is a plot displaying the efficiency of a classification model as the threshold value is varied.

The ROC curve is the True positive rate(TPR) plotted against the False positive rate(FPR) at a specified threshold.

## Error matrices

### Score
- It is the estimated probability of true in a logistic regression

### Baseline Score
- This is the score when a random guess predicts the classification. The value is mostly 0.5. This value is considered as the threshold and the model is expected to outperform the baseline score.

## How to improve the ROC curve?
- The threshold can be varied based on the business requirement to improve the error matrices like benefits/cost.
