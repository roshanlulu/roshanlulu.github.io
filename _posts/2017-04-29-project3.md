EDA, Regression and classification models will be used for the analysis of [Ames housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Datascience is used to determine best properties to buy and re-sell, identify fixed and variable charachteristics that estimate sale-price and cost-effectiveness.

Aim:
- Clean, impute, explore
- Feature engineering
- Model selection
- Plot, visualise and interpret
- Explain results


## 1. Estimating the value of homes from fixed characteristics.

```
- EDA Approach: 
    - I examined the data initially and studied the shape, data types, sample data(head).
    - Since there were 81 columns, I found it easier to categorize them before proceeding with the EDA/Cleaning.
    - While understanding data description, I assigned prefixes to the column names that indicate what the column tries to convey.
    - My approach is such that a column can have more than one prefix based on the data it tries to convey. 
    - The main purpose being ease of filtering to study different groups of data, the increase in naming complexity seemed trivial. 
    - This helped me go through the kinds of columns and helped me select the features I felt were relevant based on my finding and assumptions. These have been stated in detail along with the code.
   
- Result: 
    - Came up with predictors for modelling['TotRmsAbvGrd','TotalBsmtSF','GarageArea']
    - Tried Improvement on my model: Added a predictor ['Age_while_sale']
```

```
- Modelling with predictors after EDA:
    - Linear regression model was selected and the predictors and target from the EDA were used to build the model
    - The model was validated using Cross validation(10 fold) and Train/Test.
    - I tried different folds from 5 to 20 but there was not much of a variation.
    
- Result :
    - The R2 value is consistently ~0.60. I noticed that the score reduces if any of the parameter is removed.
    - Tried Improvement on my model: The R2 value is ~0.70 with addition of the Age_while_sale data, which is better than previous score.
	- Residual = 2.9055017504e+12
```

```
- Modelling with all the fixed predictors:
    - After finding all the fixed predictors. The predictors were fit to a linear regression model.

- Result: 
    - R2 was not very good as the variations in training and testing sets and cross validation were very different.
```

```
- Regularization Approach and Re-modelling:
- Ridge and Lasso regularisation techniques were used to find the the predictors for best fit

- Result:
    - R2 improved to ~ 0.8
    - Residual decreased to 1.29298602915e+12

(Possible future work:- Clean MSSubclass data and add it )
```

## 2. Determine any value of *changeable* property characteristics unexplained by the *fixed* ones.

```
- Modelling:
	- Since the aim is to find if there is any improvement in model when the rdenovatable features are added, a model was fit with all the renovatable features along with final fixed features from the last part of qn 1.

    - Results:
	- R2 of the model was quite varied in this stage. Hence a regularisation needs to be done.

- Regularization:

    - Results:
	- R2 improved to  ~0.9
	- Residual : 880967567628.0; There was no improvement in the residual, instead there was an increase, which is not desirable.
	 
- Infer: 
    - The second model suggest that renovating the houses may not provide any profit, instead it may even result in a net loss. 
```

## 3. What property characteristics predict an "abnormal" sale?

```
- Approach:
	- Created a new feature which suggests if the Sale condition is Abnormal or not based on the SaleCondition column. This is done since we are only interested in Abnormal Sale conditions.
	- Looking at the features, came up with a set of possible features that may result in Abnormal Salecondition.
	- In order to check their relation, I plotted graphs against the Abnormal feature and each of the selected possible predictors.

    - Inference:
	- I have tried to study the Abnormal Sale condition based on the historical data. The count of of Abnormal sale condition is not extremely high. The following inference has been made base don available data :
		- Sale Price:
		Lower Sale price results in more Abnormal Sale conditions when compared to higher Sale prices.
		- MSZoning:
		Residential Low Density zones seem to have higher no of Abnormal Sale condition compared to the other residential areas.
		- Building Type:
		Single-family Detached dwelling are the only ones that have has Abnormal sale conditions.
		- Neighborhood
		Briardale seems to be a leading the count in Abnormal Salecondition compared to other Neighbourhoods.
		- Sale Type:
		If the Sale Type is in a category not defined in the data description there seem to be higher no of Abnormal Sale conditions. It would be good to get more data on this to check further.
		
- Improvement:
    - Since we are trying to predict a yes/no feature, it might be good to use a logistic regression model and find more features than found from EDA. Given more time , it would be good to build a model to check if there are better predictors and what they are.
