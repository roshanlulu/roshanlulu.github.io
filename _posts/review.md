    - RMSE, MSE, Residual, Absolute Error, Correlation, p-value, t-stats,z stat, R2
    - Hypothesis, CLT, Confidence interval
2. Confusion matrix
3. Bias-Variance overfit
4. Data cleaning/munging
5. Feature selection, feature elimination, hyperparameters, PCA
    - Lasso, Ridge, Elastic net use cases.
    - Small dataset, penalize the features.
    - Time for different methods
