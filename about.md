I am a Data Science enthusiast pursuing my interest in analysis and problem-solving with the Data Science Immersive Course at General Assembly(Full Time 12-Weeks). 

During the course, I have gained hands on experience in data extraction, data munging, data analytics, data visualisation using real-world datasets. I have iteratively used machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis to come up with better models given a problem statement.

Before General Assembly I was working as a Software Engineer where I analysed requirements, implemented and delivered production quality software on-time. Debugging times have always included collecting data and finding insights into the issue from it. These are the skills I consider valuable for my next opportunity.

For my next role I am looking to apply my data science skills in a data-driven industry for better decision making or problem-solving.
